      <h2>Our Service Management Approach</h2>
      <p>
          Rehoboth TechBubble Inc.,  follows ITIL ,which is a compendium of best practices and offers necessary guidance. 
          We  consider it our topmost priority to " deliver value to the customers". We are willing to facilitate the outcome 
          the customers desire without them having to possess the ownership of specific costs and risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have specialized organizational capabilities to manage and implement quality IT services that meet the needs of the business. 
         The service lifecycle we follow includes Service strategy, Service design, Service transition, Service operation and Continual Service Improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
         While planning for the services to provide, we decide on the needed resources and make sure to 
         record how the services meet the business requirements. Service design produces detailed plans for each service.
         Service design ensures that we document how resources are combines to meet the specification. Service transition handles
         the physical creation and implementation of resources. In this stage, infrastructure is acquired and installed and applications are developed. 
         In the service operation stage, we provide the users and customers with the services that we have agreed with them. Continual Service Improvement 
         makes sure that the aim of providing agreed - on services is ensured. This stage ensures that all the activities in every stage work well as possible, 
         the interprocess links are effective and that all evidence of shortcomings in other stages are captured.
